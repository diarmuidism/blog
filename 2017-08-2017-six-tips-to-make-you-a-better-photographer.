title: "15 things I wish I knew before I turned twenty"
description: "Like every major milestone in life, whether it is getting a new job, losing a love one or in this case my 20th birthday you do often reflect on where you are in that very moment and wonder how you got there. Like I said my 20th birthday is soon, as in the next couple of months. I won’t give the exact date as the last time I did that I got, if I remember right 242 “Happy birthday’s”. Which was sweet and all but the terrible thing was, I am often too nice for my own good. I felt obliged to thank each individual person, which took hours. So with that I move onto the purpose of this piece. He learn every day, a new epiphany if you will.  A day without learning is a day wasted if you ask me, but saying that some things stay with you more than most. So on this quite Tuesday evening I write this  list of fifteen things I wish I knew before I turned twenty. I could have come up with twenty but I didn’t see the point in writing an extra five just for the sake of it and wasting everybody’s time. I am writing these down as they come into my head as I feel that will bring out the lessons that mean the most to me. So with that I give you the first thing I wish I knew."
