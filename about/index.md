Hello reader, my name is Diarmuid Gillingham. Despite the English surname I live in Ireland. I am 21 years of age, I  study German and Economics in University College Cork in Ireland. As you will soon find out my three major passions in life are photography, blogging and football.

# Why have I created this website
I have created this website for two main reasons. As you can imagine between the four subjects or fields mentioned above it can be challenging to put them all in the one place on-line and still appeal to your target audience. For example the vast majority of people who follow me on twitter because of my views on Manchester United and nothing else. If I start tweeting out my photography those same people will get annoyed and press the unfollow button. So I avoid doing that as much as possible.

Which leads me onto my second reason. Again I come back to my four subjects. They have very little to do with each other at times. So many people may know about one thing I do and not another. I don’t want people to get the false impression that I can do one thing and nothing else.  So my hope for this site is that it will make it easy for people to access all the content I do without having to push it in their faces.

# My Interest in football
I have a general interest in all sports, but my heart belongs to the beautiful game that is football. The interest was always there but it was kicked into a higher  gear when I discovered the “The Theatre of Dreams” better known as Old Trarfford.  With the two best young players in the country (Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo) and my fellow Corkonian Roy Keane at the club the dream was always to play for Manchester United. That dream never did happen but getting to be involved with The [United Stand](http://theunitedstand.com/) is the next best thing.

# My Love of photography
This is something I find near impossible to explain myself but I came across a quote that sums it up perfectly. There’s this photographer named Robert Frank. He said “When people look at my pictures I want them to feel the way they do when the read a line of a poem twice” I think what he was trying to say was that he wanted people to look at his pictures in detail, to examine every little pixel. In my own opinion a picture really is worth a thousand words. It can be viewed in so many ways, analysed in so many manners. Like any art form there is no exact question, answer or solution. It just simply tells the story of a spit moment that would have being lost in time otherwise. No matter what kind of life you live, or how much attention you pay, it is impossible to take in every little thing. But with a picture you can, even if it just a split moment.

# My Writing
Story writing in the traditional sense is something I would like to try at some stage but right now my writing has being focused on sports articles and interviews. Which in its own way is story telling.  You will be able to find the majority of my work for other sites on this website in the archive section. I have written in recent times for.
