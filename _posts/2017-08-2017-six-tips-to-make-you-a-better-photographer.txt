title: "Six Tips To Make You a Better Photographer"
description: "Like so many others have at some stage in their lives I suffered from a feeling of isolation, uncertainty and straight up confusion about where I was going and more importantly where I wanted to go. Regrettably I suffered a lot of this in silence during those summer months not even telling the people I held closest fearing I would become a pain or be seen as weak. In many ways I guess I was fooling myself. I remember I would go to work and as soon as I punched out I would go to the gym or do an activity I thought would not result In me having to interact with others if I didn’t want to which I usually didn’t. Looking back it just screams red flag that I was thinking that, but I ignored it. I couldn’t be less macho if I tried. I will be the first to admit that. So the idea of saying “something is really wrong” and this is not just a bad day was simply unthinkable. I felt whatever credibility I had as a guy would have evaporated as quickly as a puddle on a hot Spanish summer’s day.  So I put on the happy face."
