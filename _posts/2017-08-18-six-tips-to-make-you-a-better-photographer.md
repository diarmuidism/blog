	Don’t Rely On Editing And Cropping

While editing software’s like photoshop and websites like Instagram exist and can be very useful, it is important to keep your use of these limited. This is because if you are fixing every mistake and blemish after the photo is taken your photography skills are not improving. Photoshop can only do so much. It is vital to do your best to get your photo correct from the camera itself. First of all, it is less work for you in post production. Secondly, it will force you to look at the different indicators on your camera and you will soon develop a better understanding of lighting, exposure, how to fill the frame and so on. Cropping can also have an extra danger as any crop will reduce the quality of a photo which may cause it to become pixelated and unattractive. 

 

	Look At Other People’s Work/ Join The Local Camera Club 

While often photography can be enjoyed best, alone, you can’t do everything on your own. Whether, you are looking for new ideas or hoping to learn something new, the work of others can inspire you and push you to push your limits. For example, create a new Instagram account and simply follow photographers that post work better than your own. You will first of all quickly see what works and what doesn’t work. Next, the photos will inspire you to go out and take more and more photos. Secondly, join the photography club in your local city or school. There is bound to be plenty of people you can learn from and even if you feel you are one of the stronger members of the group, giving other people advice will make you think about your own work and help you understand what you shoot the way you do. 

 

	Think About Photos Even When You Don’t Have Your Camera

It is not always possible to have your camera with you. Saying this you can always look around you and imagine that you do. If you get a free moment, take in your surroundings and ask yourself what would you be doing if you had your camera right now? Where would you stand? Would you use a filter? How would you go about filling the frame and so on. In many ways, you are capturing what could be rather than what it is right now. Exciting right?
